# Chronic-Covid-Predictor
Machine learning model to predict if someone will develop chronic or Fatal Covid Case.
This project is designed to decentralised knowledge about Covid-19 health impact.
We will be using Machine learning to predict the likelihood of chronic or fatal symptoms.
There adequate data to implement a reliable analysis to determine features that may trigger chronic symtoms.
The project results can also help to encourage more people to consider Vaccination.
